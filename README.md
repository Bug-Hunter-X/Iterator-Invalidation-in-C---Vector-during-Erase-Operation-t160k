This repository demonstrates a common bug in C++ involving iterator invalidation when using `std::vector::erase()`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from modifying the vector while iterating through it with an index-based approach.  The solution showcases the safe and correct way to remove elements from a vector during iteration.  Understanding this issue is crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior and potential crashes in C++ programs.
